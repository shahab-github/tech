### Special Permissions in Linux
**umask**: Umask (user file-creation mode mask) is a command in Linux that sets and displays the default permissions for newly created files and directories.
The default creation permissions for files are **666** and for directories **777**

For example, to calculate how umask 022 will affect newly created files and directories, use:

Files: 666 - 022 = 644. The owner can read and modify the files. Group and others can only read the files.
Directories: 777 - 022 = 755.The owner can cd into the directory, and list, read, modify, create or delete the files in the directory. Group and others can cd into the directory and list and read the files.

To make the changes permanent, set the new umask value in a global configuration file like /etc/profile file which will affect all users or in a userâ€™s shell configuration files such as ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc, which will affect only the user. The user files have precedence over the global files.
